## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was my first time using the picture element.

I shouldn't use a width and a height attribute for my source element

```html
<picture>
  <source
    media="(min-width: 800px)"
    srcset="images/image-product-desktop.jpg"
  />
  <img
    src="images/image-product-mobile.jpg"
    alt="Eau de Parfum"
    width="320"
    height="350"
  />
</picture>
```

I should not nest an anchor tag inside of a button.Instead I should style the anchor tag to look like a button

### Continued development

I want to start using picture elements or srcset attribute + width descriptor along with sizes attribute in my html files to give the proper images to the user based on their device's viewport width.
